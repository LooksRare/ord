`ord`
=====

`ord` is an index, block explorer, and command-line wallet. It is experimental
software with no warranty. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for more details.

Ordinal theory imbues satoshis with numismatic value, allowing them to
be collected and traded as curios.

Ordinal numbers are serial numbers for satoshis, assigned in the order in which
they are mined, and preserved across transactions.

See [the docs](https://docs.ordinals.com) for documentation and guides.

See [the BIP](bip.mediawiki) for a technical description of the assignment and
transfer algorithm.

See [the project board](https://github.com/orgs/ordinals/projects/1) for
currently prioritized issues.

Building
--------

On Linux, `ord` requires `libssl-dev` when building from source.

On Debian-derived Linux distributions, including Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get install pkg-config libssl-dev build-essential
```

On Red Hat-derived Linux distributions:

```
yum install -y pkgconfig openssl-devel
yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
```

You'll also need Rust:

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Clone the `ord` repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/ordinals/ord.git
cd ord
```

To build a specific version of `ord`, first checkout that version:

```
git checkout <VERSION>
```

And finally to actually build `ord`:

```
cargo build --release
```

Once built, the `ord` binary can be found at `./target/release/ord`.

`ord` requires `rustc` version 1.76.0 or later. Run `rustc --version` to ensure
you have this version. Run `rustup update` to get the latest stable release.

### Docker

A Docker image can be built with:

```
docker build -t ordinals/ord .
```

Contributing
------------

If you wish to contribute there are a couple things that are helpful to know. We
put a lot of emphasis on proper testing in the code base, with three broad
categories of tests: unit, integration and fuzz. Unit tests can usually be found at
the bottom of a file in a mod block called `tests`. If you add or modify a
function please also add a corresponding test. Integration tests try to test
end-to-end functionality by executing a subcommand of the binary. Those can be
found in the [tests](tests) directory. We don't have a lot of fuzzing but the
basic structure of how we do it can be found in the [fuzz](fuzz) directory.

We strongly recommend installing [just](https://github.com/casey/just) to make
running the tests easier. To run our CI test suite you would do:

```
just ci
```

This corresponds to the commands:

```
cargo fmt -- --check
cargo test --all
cargo test --all -- --ignored
```

Have a look at the [justfile](justfile) to see some more helpful recipes
(commands). Here are a couple more good ones:

```
just fmt
just fuzz
just doc
just watch ltest --all
```

If the tests are failing or hanging, you might need to increase the maximum
number of open files by running `ulimit -n 1024` in your shell before you run
the tests, or in your shell configuration.

We also try to follow a TDD (Test-Driven-Development) approach, which means we
use tests as a way to get visibility into the code. Tests have to run fast for that
reason so that the feedback loop between making a change, running the test and
seeing the result is small. To facilitate that we created a mocked Bitcoin Core
instance in [test-bitcoincore-rpc](./test-bitcoincore-rpc).

Syncing
-------

`ord` requires a synced `bitcoind` node with `-txindex` to build the index of
satoshi locations. `ord` communicates with `bitcoind` via RPC.

If `bitcoind` is run locally by the same user, without additional
configuration, `ord` should find it automatically by reading the `.cookie` file
from `bitcoind`'s datadir, and connecting using the default RPC port.

If `bitcoind` is not on mainnet, is not run by the same user, has a non-default
datadir, or a non-default port, you'll need to pass additional flags to `ord`.
See `ord --help` for details.

`bitcoind` RPC Authentication
-----------------------------

`ord` makes RPC calls to `bitcoind`, which usually requires a username and
password.

By default, `ord` looks a username and password in the cookie file created by
`bitcoind`.

The cookie file path can be configured using `--cookie-file`:

```
ord --cookie-file /path/to/cookie/file server
```

Alternatively, `ord` can be supplied with a username and password on the
command line:

```
ord --bitcoin-rpc-username foo --bitcoin-rpc-password bar server
```

Using environment variables:

```
export ORD_BITCOIN_RPC_USERNAME=foo
export ORD_BITCOIN_RPC_PASSWORD=bar
ord server
```

Or in the config file:

```yaml
bitcoin_rpc_username: foo
bitcoin_rpc_password: bar
```

Examples running via command line:

To run ord event server
```
ord --bitcoin-rpc-url "http://localhost:18332" --bitcoin-rpc-username user --bitcoin-rpc-password password --commit-interval 10 --rabbitmq-url localhost --rabbitmq-password s3cr3t --rabbitmq-username indexer --rabbitmq-exchange ord-tx --chain testnet --data-dir ./index-data event-server --http-port 8080
```

To run ord event indexer
```
ord --rabbitmq-url localhost --rabbitmq-password s3cr3t --rabbitmq-username indexer event-consumer --blocks-queue btc-blocks-q --inscriptions-queue btc-inscription-q --database-url postgresql://backend:looks-backend@localhost:55432/ordinals --ord-api-url http://localhost:8080
```

Logging
--------

`ord` uses [env_logger](https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/). Set the
`RUST_LOG` environment variable in order to turn on logging. For example, run
the server and show `info`-level log messages and above:

```
$ RUST_LOG=info cargo run server
```
